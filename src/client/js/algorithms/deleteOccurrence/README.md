## Delete Occurrence
Given a list lst and a number N,
create a new list that contains
each number of lst at most N times
without reordering.

For example if N = 2,
and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3],
you take [1,2,3,1,2],
drop the next [1,2]
since this would lead to 1 and 2
being in the result 3 times,
and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].
