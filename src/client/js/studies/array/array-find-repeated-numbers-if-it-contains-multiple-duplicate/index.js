// This is actually the follow-up question of problem 2, how to find duplicate number on integer array. In that case, array contains only one duplicate but what if it contains multiple duplicates?

// Suppose, an array contains n numbers ranging from 0 to n-1 and there are 5 duplicates on it, how do you find it?

// You can use the approach, we have learned in similar String based problem of finding repeated characters in given String.
