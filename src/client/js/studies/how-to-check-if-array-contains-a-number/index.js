// This problem is essentially how to search an element in array. There are two options sequential search or binary search. You should ask interviewer about whether array is sorted or not, if array is sorted then you can use binary search to check if given number is present in array or not.

// Complexity of binary search is O(logN). BTW, if interviewer say that array is not sorted then you can still sort and perform binary search otherwise you can use sequential search. Time complexity of sequential search in array is O(n).
