//NOTE : another way of approaching the issue is to force this to actually point
// at the foo function object:

function foo(num) {
    console.log( "foo: " + num );

    // keep track of how many times `foo` is called
    // Note: `this` IS actually `foo` now, based on
    // how `foo` is called (see below)
    this.count++;
}

foo.count = 0;

var i;

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
    if (i > 5) {
        // using `call(..)`, we ensure the `this`
        // points at the function object (`foo`) itself
        foo.call( foo, i );
    }
}
// foo: 6
// foo: 7
// foo: 8
// foo: 9

// how many times was `foo` called?
console.log( foo.count ); // 4

// Instead of avoiding this, we embrace it. We'll explain in a
// little bit how such techniques work much more completely,
// so don't worry if you're still a bit confused!
